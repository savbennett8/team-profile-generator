### Installation
Clone the code onto your machine and run "npm install" from the root of the directory. Then run "node index.js" to start the question prompts. Once you are done adding members to your team, find the 'index.html' file in the 'dist' directory and open it in your browser. There's your team profile page!

### Usage
#### From the command-line, you will be prompted to enter the following information:
* Team manager's name, employee ID, email address and office number.
* Choose to add an engineer or intern, or to finish building your team.
* If engineer is chosen, you will need to enter their name, ID, email & GitHub username, then you will be returned to the menu.
* If intern is selected, you will need to enter their name, ID, email, & school, then you will be returned to the menu.
* Once you select that you are finished building your team, exit the application and the HTML is generated.

#### What You Can Expect 
* A nicely formatted HTML file that displays your team's roster.
* When you click on an email address, it opens your default email program & enters the selected email in the 'TO' field.
* When you click the GitHub username, their GitHub profile will open in a new tab.

### Tests
I used Jest to run tests against the classes and constructors to make sure the objects and information being created were all good. You can run "npm run test" from the root of the directory in the command-line to see the tests pass.
